## :bookmark_tabs: Technologies Used

1.  **HTML5 & CSS3**

    The layout as well as the burger elements were built with CSS3. Feel free to inspect the code to see how they were created.

2.  **React + Redux + Router**

    React was used heavily throughout this project with multiple components. This project makes use of Redux to provide for a central store and make state management easier. The application also uses React Router for managing routes locally.

3.  **Firebase**

    The application was deployed on firebase for a simple database solution to hold the orders and login information.
